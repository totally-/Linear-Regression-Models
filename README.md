# Linear-Regression-Models

This program creates all possible linear regression models and each of their respective values for p, Cp, AdjR^2, SSE, AIC, and PRESS as follows:

p = regression parameters. k is the number of predictor variables, which means we have k+1 regression parameters AKA p = k+1

Cp = Mallow's Cp

AdjR^2 = adjusted R-squared

SSE = sum of squares error

AIC = Akaike information criterion

PRESS =  predicted residual error sum of squares

NOTE: This program allows the user to enter one to six predictor variables, inclusive. The console must also be resized to display the output correctly.  I left all comments in this submission in case I want to return to it later and make corrections.

In this example, the dataset, "APPENC03", must be imported into R-studio.
