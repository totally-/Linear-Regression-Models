# Linear-Regression-Models

This program creates all possible linear regression models and each of their respective values for p, Cp, AdjR^2, SSE, AIC, and PRESS as follows:

p = regression parameters. k is the number of predictor variables, which means we have k+1 regression parameters AKA p = k+1

Cp = Mallow's Cp

AdjR^2 = adjusted R-squared

SSE = sum of squares error

AIC = Akaike information criterion

PRESS =  predicted residual error sum of squares

NOTE: this program is unfinished and is only good for twelve predictor variables and only tested for six or so. So, I guess that means it's actually only good for approximately six.  I didn't know how to implement the program in a dynamic way when I initially wrote it (I hadn't taken the data structures course yet).  The program is also not ideal because predictor variables must be assigned manually and same with the number of predictor variables.  The console must also be resized to display the output correctly.  I left all comments in this submission in case I want to return to it later and make corrections.
